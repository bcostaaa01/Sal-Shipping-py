# 📦 Sal-Shipping-py
This program takes the weight of a package and determines the cheapest way to ship that package using Sal’s Shippers.

# 🐍 Code explanation

1. A variable is created to store the weight of the package to be shipped.
2. Then, two chunks of if statements and one variable storing the rate of Premium Ground Shipping are created. The if statements check for the weight and calculate the cost of the Ground and Drone shipping.
3. Then, the cost is calculated and printed so the sender can see how much it will cost to send their package with each of the three shipping methods.
